# OSTRICH
_Offset-enabled TRIple store for CHangesets_

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rdfostrich/ostrich.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rdfostrich/ostrich)
[![Docker Automated Build](https://img.shields.io/docker/automated/rdfostrich/ostrich.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/rdfostrich/ostrich/)
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/97819866.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/97819866)

A triple store that allows multiple dataset versions to be stored and queried.
The store is a hybrid between snapshot, delta and timestamp-based storage,
which provides a good trade-off between storage size and query time.
Version materialized, version and delta materialized queries can be performed efficiently over the different versions.
These queries support limits and offsets for any triple pattern, as results are returned as triple streams.

Insertion is done by first inserting a dataset snapshot, which is encoded in [HDT](rdfhdt.org).
After that, deltas can be inserted, which contain additions and deletions based on the last delta or snapshot.

## Building

OSTRICH requires ZLib, Kyoto Cabinet and CMake (compilation only) to be installed.

Compile:
```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

## Running

The OSTRICH dataset will always be loaded from the current directory.

### Tests
```bash
build/ostrich_test
```

### Query
```bash
build/ostrich-query-version-materialized patch_id s p o
build/ostrich-query-delta-materialized patch_id_start patch_id_end s p o
build/ostrich-query-version patch_id_start s p o
```

### Insert
```bash
build/ostrich-insert [-v] patch_id [+|- file_1.nt [file_2.nt [...]]]*
```

Input deltas must be sorted in SPO-order.

### Evaluate
Only load changesets from a path structured as `path_to_patch_directory/patch_id/main.nt.additions.txt` and `path_to_patch_directory/patch_id/main.nt.deletions.txt`.
```bash
build/ostrich-evaluate path_to_patch_directory patch_id_start patch_id_end
```
CSV-formatted insert data will be emitted: `version,added,durationms,rate,accsize`.

Load changesets AND query with triple patterns from the given file on separate lines, with the given number of replications.
```bash
build/ostrich-evaluate path_to_patch_directory patch_id_start patch_id_end patch_to_queries/queries.txt s|p|o nr_replications
```
CSV-formatted query data will be emitted (time in microseconds) for all versions for the three query types: `patch,offset,limit,count-ms,lookup-mus,results`.

## Docker

Alternatively, OSTRICH can be built and run using Docker.

### Build
```bash
docker build -t ostrich .
```

Instead of building the container yourself, you can use the pre-built image from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rdfostrich/ostrich/).
```bash
docker pull rdfostrich/ostrich
```

### Test
```bash
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /opt/patchstore/build/ostrich_test ostrich
```

### Query
```bash
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /opt/ostrich/build/ostrich-query-version-materialized ostrich patch_id s p o
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /opt/ostrich/build/ostrich-delta-version-materialized ostrich patch_id_start patch_id_end s p o
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /opt/ostrich/build/ostrich-query-version ostrich s p o
```

### Insert
```bash
docker run --rm -it --entrypoint /opt/ostrich/build/ostrich-insert ostrich [-v] patch_id [+|- file_1.nt [file_2.nt [...]]]*
```

### Evaluate

Only load changesets from a path structured as `path_to_patch_directory/patch_id/main.nt.additions.txt` and `path_to_patch_directory/patch_id/main.nt.deletions.txt`.
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v path_to_patch_directory:/var/patches ostrich /var/patches patch_id_start patch_id_end
```

Load changesets AND query with triple patterns from the given file on separate lines, with the given number of replications.
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v path_to_patch_directory:/var/patches -v patch_to_queries:/var/queries ostrich /var/patches patch_id_start patch_id_end /var/queries/queries.txt s|p|o nr_replications
```

Enable debug mode:
```bash
docker run --rm -it -v path_to_patch_directory:/var/patches -v patch_to_queries:/var/queries -v path_to_crash_dir:/crash --privileged=true ostrich --debug /var/patches patch_id_start patch_id_end /var/queries/queries.txt s|p|o nr_replications
```

## Compiler variables
`PATCH_INSERT_BUFFER_SIZE`: The size of the triple parser buffer during patch insertion. (default `100`)

`FLUSH_POSITIONS_COUNT`: The amount of triples after which the patch positions should be flushed to disk, to avoid memory issues. (default `500000`)

`FLUSH_TRIPLES_COUNT`: The amount of triples after which the store should be flushed to disk, to avoid memory issues. (default `500000`)

`KC_MEMORY_MAP_SIZE`: The KC memory map size per tree. (default `1LL << 27` = 128MB)

`KC_PAGE_CACHE_SIZE`: The KC page cache size per tree. (default `1LL << 25` = 32MB)

`MIN_ADDITION_COUNT`: The minimum addition triple count so that it will be stored in the db. Changing this value only has effect during insertion time. Lookups are compatible with any value. (default `200`)
